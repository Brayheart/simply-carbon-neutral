/* 

Questions:

- In server.js, confused by " res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "./client/build/index.html"));  build directory??"

- And "app.use(express.static("client/build"));"

- Given this, how does it know to use index.html in public

- Why client/public/manifest.json?  In case you want to create a PWA
